## Project decription

The goal of this project is for anyone to be able to upload a photo of a meal they are about to eat and get information on the common allergens in it
The main point of this is to inform those with allergies the potential allergens they could be consuming in an unknown food should they come across a 
food they've never heard of before. This could be useful if someone is travelling and comes across an unknown food or they get served a dish they are
not sure is safe. The neural network in this project will be able to identify up to 101 food items and return common allergens of those. The dataset
it would be trained on is found here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trolukovich/food11-image-dataset?resource=download with the 10 classes used being 
Bread, Dairy product, Dessert, Egg, Fried food, Meat, Noodles-Pasta, Rice, Seafood, and Soup.. Then a user would input a photo of their meal and the 
neural net would identify it and return potential allergens contained within. This project aims to protect and offer insight for people with allergies 
and give them the assurance needed to enjoy their food.
