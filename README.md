## Project decription

The goal of this project is for anyone to be able to upload a photo of a meal they are about to eat and get information on the common allergens in it
The main point of this is to inform those with allergies the potential allergens they could be consuming in an unknown food should they come across a 
food they've never heard of before. This could be useful if someone is travelling and comes across an unknown food or they get served a dish they are
not sure is safe. The neural network in this project will be able to identify up to 101 food items and return common allergens of those. The dataset
it would be trained on is found here https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/food101, which consists of 101,000 images. And, for each class, 250 
manually reviewed test images were provided as well as 750 training images. Then a user would input a photo of their meal and the neural net would 
identify it and return potential allergens contained within. This project aims to protect and offer insight for people with allergies and give them
the assurance needed to enjoy their food.
